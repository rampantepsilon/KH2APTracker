# KH2APTracker
Kingdom Hearts 2 Randomizer Tracker for Archipelago Multiworlds

## FAQs

### How does this track my items?
The tracker asks for the server information at launch. It then communicates with the AP Server just like the client to receive a list of items the player has.

### Does it track levels?
Technically, no it does not connect to the game to get information like levels, stats, etc. It does, however, track the form levels that you have checked in the system as well as track if you force Final Form.

### Can this be used in async APs?
It 100% can be used in asyncs. When testing, I was working on testing with asyncs in mind. The only thing you have to do for an async is save the form levels. However, saving will persist between launches meaning you can come back later. (Note: This hasn't been tested with power cycling a PC yet. You might lose the save if you reboot your computer during an async.)

### What is the noises I'm hearing from the app?
It's probably one of two things. If it's a chime from KH2, that's saying you picked up a Lucky Emblem. From testing, you shouldn't have these be cued in a line (i.e. if you get 2 in a row it probably will only chime once.)

If it's not the chime, then it's probably "The Quilted Quicker Picker Upper, BOUNTY!" This is a meme for the Bounty style KH2 goal. Credit to ZakTheRobot for the sound clip (Sound was obtained through the soundboard in Discord).

Future releases will have the sounds off by default with a toggle to turn on.
